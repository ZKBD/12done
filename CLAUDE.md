- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## Development Commands
All commands run inside Docker containers:

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up --build

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec app npx prisma migrate dev

# Generate Prisma client
docker-compose exec app npx prisma generate

# Run tests
docker-compose exec app npm test

# Run e2e tests
docker-compose exec app npm run test:e2e

# View logs

## Requirements Documentation

### SRS Reference
The Software Requirements Specification is in `12done_SRS.docx`. Requirements are tagged with IDs (e.g., PROD-001, USER-001) for traceability.

### Lower-Level Requirements
Detailed implementation tasks are in `docs/LOWER_LEVEL_REQUIREMENTS.md` and `docs/LOWER_LEVEL_REQUIREMENTS_PART2.md`. Each high-level SRS requirement is broken down into specific, implementable tasks with acceptance criteria.

### Traceability Matrix
The `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` links requirements to test cases and results.

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation
Focus areas:
- User authentication (PROD-001 to PROD-011)
- Property listings (PROD-020 to PROD-031)
- Basic search (PROD-040 to PROD-050)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all services and utilities
- E2E tests for API endpoints
- Run tests before committing: `docker-compose exec app npm test`

---

## MANDATORY: Traceability Matrix Maintenance

**IMPORTANT:** The traceability matrix at `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` MUST be kept up to date. This is a critical project requirement.

### When to Update the Matrix

Update the traceability matrix whenever:

1. **New requirements are added to the SRS**
   - Add new rows to the appropriate section
   - Set status to 🚧 (not yet implemented) or N/A
   - Include the requirement ID, description, and purpose

2. **New test cases are created**
   - Add entries linking the test to its requirement(s)
   - Include test file path and test case name
   - Write a clear "Purpose" explaining what's being tested
   - Set initial status to ⏳ (not yet run)

3. **Tests are executed**
   - Update status to ✅ (pass) or ❌ (fail)
   - Update the "Latest Test Run" section with date and results
   - Note any failures in the test execution summary

4. **Requirements are implemented**
   - Change status from 🚧 to ⏳
   - Link to the implementing test cases

### Matrix Update Procedure

```markdown
# When adding a new test case:
| PROD-XXX.Y | `testName > should do something` | file.spec.ts | Human-readable purpose | ⏳ |

# When running tests:
1. Run: docker-compose exec app npm test
2. Update status symbols (✅/❌) based on results
3. Update "Latest Test Run" table with date and summary
```

### Purpose Column Guidelines

The "Purpose" column must explain in plain English what the test verifies. Examples:

| Good Purpose | Bad Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Verifies user cannot register with existing email" | "Tests register endpoint" |
| "Ensures password is hashed before database storage" | "Checks password hashing" |
| "Confirms only property owner can delete listing" | "Tests authorization" |

### Status Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ✅ | Pass | Test executed and passed |
| ❌ | Fail | Test executed and failed |
| ⏳ | Pending | Test exists but not yet run |
| 🚧 | Not Implemented | Requirement exists, no test yet |
| N/A | Not Applicable | No test needed for this requirement |

### After Each Work Session

Before ending a session where tests were created or modified:

1. Open `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`
2. Add any new test cases to appropriate sections
3. Update statuses if tests were run
4. Update the "Update History" section at the bottom
5. Commit changes with message: `docs: update traceability matrix`

## Pending Configuration Tasks

- [ ] **Restore Happy CLI in Claude Launcher** - Check if Happy Engineering's 404 issue is resolved, then restore `happy --yolo` in launcher. Currently using `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` as workaround. To restore, run:
  ```bash
  sed -i '' 's|claude --dangerously-skip-permissions|happy --yolo|g' "/Users/zsoltkosinszky/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Claude/Claude Launcher.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher"
  ```
